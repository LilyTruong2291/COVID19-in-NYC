# Analyzing COVID-19 cases in NYC
Analyzing Covid-19 Cases in New York City to explore whether the lower income neighborhood is more likely to be infected with COVID-19?
In March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Since then, this virus has spread rapidly and affected more than 4 million people; while it has taken the lives of nearly 290,000 people worldwide (as of May 9, 2020). New York City is among one the most severely affected cities in the world, which accounts for nearly 50% of confirmed cases in the U.S.
In this analysis, I would like to use the data set provided by the New York City Department of Health about the number of tests given and the number of positive COVID - tests compared with the median income in each zip code to see whether people living in the low-income areas are more likely to be affected by the virus. 
There is a total of 3 files that I will use for this analysis:
* 1 file contains the number of tests given and the number of positive cases in each zip code
* 1 file contains the median income in each zip code
* 1 file contains the population in each zip code
The analysis has shown that the data about confirmed cases based on alone does not give us enough evidence proving that COVID-19 cases mostly affect low-income areas. Knowing how rapidly the virus spreads in the community, we would need more data such as employment status, change of commuting or ridership before and after the pandemic, household size to justify whether low-income neighbourhoods are more vulnerable to this virus.
